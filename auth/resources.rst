Resources
=========

Resources are the objects with which the users will interact. They have actions associated with
them that represent what the user is trying to perform with the resource. For example, one resource
`contacts` may have the following actions associated with it:

* `index` - index (or list) contacts
* `create` - create new contacts
* `update` - update an existing contact
* `delete` - delete contacts
